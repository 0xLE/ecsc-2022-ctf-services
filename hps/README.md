We discovered this hydroelectric power station in the Austrian Alps around 10 years ago. Vegetation took over the buildings, and most systems were unusable due to corrosion. But the massive dam was built to last, not showing cracks or other signs of structural breakdown. We needed clean power, so we started looting other power plants and abandoned factories to repair the damaged equipment.

Even if most systems are old and faulty, now the power station represents our only permanent power source that relies entirely on renewable sources. The amount of energy produced is so large that we can even accumulate the surplus for non-essential activities. We also discovered that we could perform cold starts to recover from blackouts by manually forcing the system to open its central valve.
