ECSC 2022, A/D CTF Services
===========================
A lot of information was lost, so history isn't completely clear on which events led us to arrive at this point. Some say there was a large pandemic. Others believe that the ever-growing demand for computing power to mine cryptocurrencies led to disaster. Nobody really knows anymore, but one thing is for sure: Earth doesn't look like it looked before. Climate change has taken its toll. The poles started melting, and the earth became more and more desolate.

Many moved to Austria to escape the rising sea levels. With the big cities gone, small communities started to appear. Relying on trade and exchange of goods, those factions coexisted peacefully. Communication networks were re-established and with the help of motivated hackers, civilization slowly found its way back into the lives of people. However, as global economy had faltered, those communities relied on scavenging whatever technology they could get their hands on to keep the systems up and running. Every little bit of computing power was utilized to keep society alive and also bring back some of the previous comforts.

Sadly, this status quo could not be maintained for a long time and factions started to distrust each other, attacking essential systems that prevented communities from falling back into chaos...
